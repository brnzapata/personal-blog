            <h1>Late Pokémon Addict</h1>
            <p>September 20, 2021 by Bruno</p>
            <p>Pokémon turns 25 years old in 2021! It has been amazing to see how much this brand has grown throughout the years and has 
             caused me to reflect on my own experiences with the famous pocket monster game.<br><br>
            I first played Pokémon yellow on the Gameboy Color when I was about seven years old. However, my Gameboy was stolen shortly 
            after I had started playing the game, therefore, I can’t consider this moment to be my first experience with Pokémon.<br><br>
            The first game that I completed was Pokémon X on the Nintendo 3DS. I remember having so much fun while playing this game; I 
            once I played this game for eight hours straight. The main reason I played this game was because I was able to obtain a Charizard 
            in this game and it featured “mega-evolutions” for this Pokémon and many others that I had seen while growing up.<br><br>
             I continue to play Pokémon on my Nintendo Switch and I still try and use my Charizard whenever possible. I hope to be able to 
             play this game for many more years to come and I hope that my soon-to-be-born daughter also enjoys playing this game so that we 
             may play together one day in the future.
