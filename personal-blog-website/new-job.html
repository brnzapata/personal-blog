            <h1>Why am I learning to Design Web Pages?</h1>
            <p>September 20, 2021 by Bruno</p>
            <p>Since starting my current job, I have earned a significant pay raise and have had the luxury of purchasing many items that I would have never seen myself buying a little less than five years ago. 
                The items include several Air Jordan shoes, two new cars, and several other items that can be found around the house. It has been incredible to be able to do this, however, I have had to work
                 a lot of over time to do this and unfortunately, I have burned out.<br>
                <br>My current work culture is very negative. I have found very few coworkers that enjoy working at this company in addition to myself. I don’t think anyone hates the company, but I do think that
                 many have had enough of understaffing and tolerating with ridiculous decisions that affect our work.<br>
                <br>When I left my previous job for my current one, I thought that I would be happier because of the big pay increase and the generous amount of overtime opportunities but I have found that you 
                can’t have fun with hard-earned money if you have few opportunities to spend it. I don’t want to burn all my money, but I do want to be able to go out from time to time and not have to feel guilty 
                for not saving the money because of an upcoming bill.<br>
                <br>I am not picking up this web development skill to make boat loads of money. I’m learning this skill so that I may be able to set myself up for an opportunity to at least work around people that enjoy their life and bring a positive attitude to work every day. I also think that working in this field will allow me to make slightly more money and not need to depend on over time.
