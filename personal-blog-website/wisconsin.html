            <h1>Time Traveling in the “Country”</h1>
            <p>September 20, 2021 by Bruno</p>
            <p>It’s been a little over three years since Nissa and I moved from Cicero to Kenosha. During this time, I have had a boring experience 
                while living in Wisconsin.<br>
                <br>For the most part, everything is spread out and there is lots of grassland. While it’s technically not considered country to 
                most people that live here, I consider this town to be pretty country when compared to the area that I grew up in.<br>
                <br>It’ surprising to see so many people that are unfamiliar with electronic versions of things, such as banking apps and the Door 
                Dash equivalent of snack service apps. A lot of people here prefer to go fishing or hunting on the weekends instead of going to a party 
                in the city or a bar to watch the big sporting event over the weekend.<br>
                <br>At times, I do feel as though we have traveled back in time because of how outdated the mentality is here. When I first arrived 
                in Wisconsin, my landlord lectured us on the importance of having a bank that allows you to have check books and how having physical cash 
                in your hand will always be better than some fancy-looking bank app.<br>
                <br>Unfortunately, I have about two more years to live out in Wisconsin. This is because of our new lease and because of the transition
                 of jobs that I hope to have. I would love to have at least one year of web development experience before returning to Chicago. I can’t wait
                  for that day to arrive.
